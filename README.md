Pandemic has brought a huge change in education system. Platforms such as Zoom, Google Meet, Microsoft Teams have enabled to connect the teachers and students across various parts of the world.  

It has also enabled many women to restart their career in teaching. The one thing that I felt is the channels in which the child's progress or any impending assignment/test is either through WhatsApp or Email (MS Teams for educational institutions not for private tutors).  The teacher is also not able to maintain the track record of the student .  One of my friends who is a private tutor also felt the same and she asked whether a website could be developed. I thought I could try out a POC and check out how it works.
